Two approaches for preprocessing: 
1. read all data from the file into memory, apply filters, and subsequently cut the data into interesting segments. <br>
2. identify the interesting segments, read those segments from the data file and apply the filters to  those segments only <br>

The second one is the most approprate for large data set such as the MEGG data <br> 

Three types of sentences: <br>
 In the fully congruent condition (FC) the sentences ended with a high-cloze probability word, <br>
 e.g.,  `De klimmers bereikten eindelijk de top van de berg (The climbers finally reached the top of the mountain)` 

In the fully incongruent condition (FIC) sentences ended with a semantically anomalous word which was totally unexpected given the sentential context, <br>
e.g., `De klimmers bereikten eindelijk de top van de tulp (The climbers finally reached the top of the tulip).`  

The third type of sentences ended with a semantically anomalous word that had the same initial phonemes (and lexical stress) as the high-cloze words from the congruent condition: initially congruent (IC).
