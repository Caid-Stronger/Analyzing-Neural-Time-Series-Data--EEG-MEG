## Chapter 10 Dot Product and Convolution 

## Convolution  

Once vector is considered as a `signal`  <br>
The other one is considered as a `kernal` <br> 

Convolution is performed by computing the dot product between two vectors, shifting one vector in time relative to the other vector <br>

The square wave is the signal, and the five-point linear decay function is the kernal. <br> 
Taking the kernal,flipping it backward, and then dragging it forward in time so it passess over the signal.<br> 
As it passess over the signal, it drags on the signal and the result of the drag is something looks a bit like each of them <br>
